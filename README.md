# Movie Recommendation System using Content-Based Filtering

This is a Movie Recommendation System built using Content-Based Filtering. The application takes advantage of the TMDB dataset to provide movie suggestions based on the input movie, giving users a personalized recommendation list. It is built using Python, Streamlit for the user interface, and scikit-learn for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
